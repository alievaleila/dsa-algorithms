Data Structures and Algorithms Masterclass (Java)

This repository contains my practical implementations, coding exercises, and theoretical notes from the "Data Structures and Algorithms Masterclass" course. My goal is to master fundamental computer science concepts using Java.

🚀 Project Overview
The focus of this project is to understand how different data structures work under the hood, with a strong emphasis on Memory Management and Time Complexity (O notation).

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Java 17 (Amazon Corretto)
Build System: Maven
Version Control: Git & GitHub

📚 Topics Covered
So far, I have implemented and documented the following:
1. Arrays (Memory Layout & Operations)
Concept: Understanding how arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations.
Stages: Implementation of Declaration, Instantiation, and Initialization.
Performance: Exploring why array access is O(1) due to memory address calculation.

📂 Project Structure
src/main/java/org.example: Contains the main source code and algorithm implementations.
pom.xml: Maven configuration file for project dependencies.

⚙️ How to Run
Clone the repository: git clone <your-repository-url>
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
Ensure JDK 17 is configured.
Run the Main.java file located in src/main/java/org.example/.
